**Project Explanation:**
This project involves creating a platform where users can view and write reviews for movies. This platform aims to facilitate a community-driven approach to evaluating films, and it will offer various features to enhance user engagement and provide valuable insights into movie preferences and trends. 

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the project: 

**Core Features:**

**Movie Reviewing:**

 **User Accounts:** Users will need to create accounts to write reviews. This helps in managing user-generated content and ensuring accountability.
 **Review Submission:** Users can write reviews for movies they’ve watched. This could include a star rating system (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) and a text-based review.
 **Review Moderation:** Implementing a system to moderate reviews to prevent spam and abusive language might be necessary.
